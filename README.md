# Corner-Grocer
This is the Corner Grocer application this application was created to be able to track how many item were purchased and the frequency.
For this project creating the code to count the frequency of each word was a little difficult but I was able to do it succesfully.
If I could enhance this code I would make the menu more functional and add more options as this would make it easier to input information and not quit application.
The most challenging part was the histogram and I used goodle and zybooks to help along the way if I got stuck.
I think being able to create and use classes will be helpful to further coding project as this is found in Javascript as well.
I was constantly running my code to make sure it was running properly added comments as well to state functionality.
